# **App Name**: FileSync UI

## Core Features:

- Path Input: Accept server file path inputs from the application team to locate files in the primary and DR servers.
- Directory display: Display a directory tree of all of the files at both locations for verification by the user.
- Difference Engine: Compare and list all file differences based on user inputs in UI folder structure of both side servers.
- AI-Powered conflict resolution assistant: An AI-powered tool that analyzes the displayed file differences, identifies potential conflicts or issues, and suggests resolution strategies based on the detected discrepancies.
- Sync Execution: One-click synchronization of selected files between primary and DR servers.
- Reporting and Logs: View the sync execution results.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#75A8D9) evoking trust and reliability, but with a hint of creativity.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F4F8) to ensure a clean and professional interface, not distracting from the data.
- Accent color: Pale yellow (#D4AC0D) for interactive elements like buttons, focusing on functionality over aesthetics
- Font pairing: 'Inter' for body text (sans-serif) to keep information readable, and 'Space Grotesk' for headlines (sans-serif) to give the app a high-tech feeling.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying paths and code snippets (monospace).
- Minimalist icons representing file types, status, and actions to reduce visual clutter.
- Clean, structured layout with clear visual hierarchy. Use of whitespace to avoid overwhelming the user.
- Subtle animations to indicate progress and status, such as loading bars during synchronization or file comparison.
